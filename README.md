# TSP_using_PSO
This repository provides an implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The TSP is a classic combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.
