# TSP_using_PSO
This repository provides an implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The TSP is a classic combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.

## Features:

**PSO Implementation:** The repository contains a comprehensive PSO implementation tailored to solve the TSP. PSO is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish, making it well-suited for solving complex combinatorial problems like the TSP.

**Modular Architecture:** The code is organized into modular components, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend. Each module is well-documented, enabling users to dive into the specifics of the PSO algorithm and its integration with the TSP.

**Customizable Parameters:** The implementation allows users to customize various PSO parameters such as swarm size, inertia weight, cognitive and social parameters, and convergence criteria. This flexibility enables researchers and practitioners to fine-tune the algorithm to their specific problem instances.

**Visualization Tools:** The repository provides visualization tools to help users visualize the convergence process of the PSO algorithm and the resulting TSP solutions. Visualizations include animated particle movements, convergence plots, and interactive route maps.

**Benchmark Data:** A curated collection of benchmark TSP instances is included, ranging from small to large problem sizes. This allows users to test the algorithm's performance across different scenarios and compare it against other optimization techniques.

**Performance Metrics:** The repository computes and displays various performance metrics for the obtained TSP solutions, such as solution quality, computation time, and convergence speed. This aids in assessing the effectiveness of the PSO algorithm in solving TSP instances.
